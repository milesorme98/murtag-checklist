check the status of your routers:
list

to access a router:
telnet $ip 2000

By default, we are placed in the User EXEC Mode and to make any configuration, we need to move to the Privilege EXEC Mode.

To get to the Privilege EXEC mode, we need to type the following command in the current console and press ENTER:
enable

To begin our configuration, we need to go into the global configuration mode. The command to achieve this is:
configure terminal

It is always a good practice to change the hostname of any device you are newly configuring.
hostname ISP_RTR

Now, we will configure an IP address of 192.0.2.1 (prefix length /30) on this interface. This can be achieved using the following command:
ip address 192.0.2.1 255.255.255.252
