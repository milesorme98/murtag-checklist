FILE UPLOAD VULNERABILITY

- attackers can abuse a file upload feature to upload malicious scripts 
- script is executed and allows for further attacks (webshell)
- filters might be in place on the webserver based on content-type, Extension, names, size etc

Beating content-type checks in file uploads
- alot of developers base content type checks based on what is expected
- if the developer only wants gif images to be uploaded he can check the file for "image/gif"
- to get around this we need to set up a proxy to intercept the request and change the content type to what is expected

We can use burp to change the "content type:" section of a request so that we can upload .php files but change he content type to content type: image/gif.
this will allow us to upload a php backdoor on the system
